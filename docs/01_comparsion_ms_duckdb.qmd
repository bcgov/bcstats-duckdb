### **Summary: Which One to Choose?**

1. **MS SQL Server**:
   - **Best for**: Larger teams with higher concurrency needs, where large datasets (hundreds of GB to TBs) are processed, and where data security, transactional integrity, and enterprise-level features (like backups, partitioning, user management) are crucial.
   - **Pros**: Great scalability, advanced analytics (OLAP and OLTP support), cloud-friendly, and multi-user support.
   - **Cons**: Expensive (for enterprise), requires more setup, admin, and maintenance, which might be overkill for small-to-medium datasets that update quarterly or annually.

2. **DuckDB**:
   - **Best for**: Small data science teams working with medium-sized datasets (up to several GBs) that update periodically (quarterly or annually). Ideal for those who want fast, in-memory analytics embedded directly into their R or Python workflow without needing to maintain a full database server.
   - **Pros**: Lightweight, free, easy to install, minimal maintenance, fast analytics, and works seamlessly in R or Python. Perfect for research or exploratory analysis.
   - **Cons**: Not suited for large datasets (100GB+), lacks robust concurrency, and is less suitable for environments requiring strict transactional capabilities or enterprise-level features.

For a small data science and economic research team, **DuckDB** is likely the more practical and cost-effective choice unless you expect to scale up to enterprise-level datasets or need multi-user support.

3. **SQLite** 

A comparative table of **SQLite** and **DuckDB**, focusing on characteristics relevant to a small data science and economic research team, especially in the context of periodic updates to data tables (quarterly or annually).

### **Summary: SQLite vs. DuckDB**

1. **SQLite**:
   - **Best for**: Teams that need a reliable, disk-based database with strong support for CRUD operations and periodic updates, but who don’t require advanced analytics. It's excellent for storing, updating, and managing small to medium datasets, especially when tables are updated regularly (e.g., quarterly).
   - **Pros**: Simple setup, efficient for data persistence and regular updates, widely supported, and requires minimal maintenance.
   - **Cons**: Not optimized for complex analytics or large datasets. Performance decreases with more complex queries and when datasets become large.

2. **DuckDB**:
   - **Best for**: Data science teams focused on analytical workloads who need to perform complex queries, joins, and aggregations over medium-sized datasets. Ideal when the data is updated infrequently (e.g., quarterly) and needs fast, in-memory processing for research and exploratory tasks.
   - **Pros**: Blazing fast for analytical tasks, easy to set up, and integrates directly into data science workflows. No server needed.
   - **Cons**: Not as efficient for frequent updates or transactional workloads. Not optimized for concurrent multi-user environments.

### **Which Should You Choose?**

- **SQLite**: Choose this if your team primarily needs a stable, file-based database for storing and updating data tables regularly (e.g., quarterly or annually) and you don’t need heavy-duty analytics capabilities.
- **DuckDB**: Choose this if your team’s focus is on analytical tasks, and you need to perform fast, in-memory computations on datasets that fit within memory. It’s ideal if you only update data periodically and then perform heavy analytical queries.

For your use case of **many medium-sized economic datasets updated quarterly or annually**, **DuckDB** is likely to provide better performance for analytical tasks. However, **SQLite** may be more suitable if your primary focus is on updating and managing data tables efficiently. If the main goal is to perform analysis after data updates rather than managing concurrent updates, DuckDB could be a superior option due to its analytical power.
