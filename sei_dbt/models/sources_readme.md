The `source.yml` file in **dbt** is used to define **sources**—these are the raw data inputs to your dbt project. A source typically represents an external system where data is ingested from (e.g., a data warehouse, an API, or in your case, CSV files). The source definition helps dbt understand where the data is coming from and allows you to validate, reference, and document your raw data within the dbt project.

### What is a `source.yml`?

In dbt, the `source.yml` file is where you define your raw data sources, including their **name**, **location**, and any associated **tables**. Defining sources in dbt allows you to:
- **Reference** the raw data sources in your models (via the `source()` function).
- **Document** the data lineage, making it clear where the data is coming from.
- **Test** the raw data for quality (e.g., checking for uniqueness, null values, etc.).

Here’s an example `source.yml` that defines a source:

```yaml
version: 2

sources:
  - name: raw_csv_data  # Name of the data source
    description: "Raw data from CSV files"
    tables:
      - name: sales_data
        description: "Sales data extracted from CSV"
      - name: customers_data
        description: "Customer data extracted from CSV"
```

In this file:
- **`sources`** defines the external system or file from which the raw data is being ingested.
- **`tables`** are the individual datasets (e.g., CSV files) that you're working with in dbt.

### Is it a good practice to save CSV file paths in `source.yml`?

While it's possible to save **metadata** about your CSV files in `source.yml` (such as table names or descriptions), **saving the actual file paths directly in `source.yml` is not a common best practice**. Here’s why:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: The `source.yml` file is designed for documenting and referencing the data sources, not for handling the specifics of how or where the data is physically located. You’d typically define the path to your CSV files directly in your SQL models using the `read_csv_auto()` function (for DuckDB).

2. **Flexibility**: Storing file paths in the SQL model itself makes it easier to manage the dynamic aspects of file loading. If the file path changes, updating it in one place (the model) is more straightforward than managing it within a YAML file.

3. **Code Simplicity**: SQL is where you typically handle file access logic. The logic for reading files (such as the `read_csv_auto()` function in DuckDB) belongs in the SQL files to maintain clarity in where and how the raw data is being accessed.

### Where to Reference the File Path?

For example, in the staging model where you load data from the CSV, you would typically handle the file path directly in the SQL:

```sql
{{ config(materialized='table') }}

-- Load raw data from the CSV file
select *
from read_csv_auto('data/sales_data.csv');
```

### How to Reference Sources in dbt Models?

Once you have defined a source in `source.yml`, you can reference it in your SQL models using the `source()` function, which is a cleaner and more abstracted way to refer to raw data.

If you want to reference a raw CSV data table defined in `source.yml`, you could use:

```sql
select *
from {{ source('raw_csv_data', 'sales_data') }};
```

Here, `raw_csv_data` is the name of the source (from `source.yml`), and `sales_data` is the specific table you are referencing.

### When to Use `source.yml` for CSVs?

While storing the actual file path in `source.yml` isn't a good practice, you can still use `source.yml` for the following reasons:
1. **Data Documentation**: You can describe the structure and purpose of each CSV file in your project. This is useful for documentation and helps others understand your data pipeline.
2. **Testing Raw Data**: dbt allows you to apply tests on sources defined in `source.yml`, which is a helpful way to ensure data quality.
   - For example, you could test that the `sales_data` table (CSV file) has unique `order_id` values:

   ```yaml
   version: 2

   sources:
     - name: raw_csv_data
       tables:
         - name: sales_data
           description: "Sales data extracted from CSV"
           tests:
             - unique: order_id
             - not_null: order_id
   ```

### Best Practice: Where to Handle CSV File Paths?

Here’s a summary of the best practices:

- **`source.yml` for Metadata and Documentation**: Use the `source.yml` file to define metadata about your CSV files, including table names, descriptions, and data quality tests. This is good for documentation and testing but doesn't include the actual file path.

- **SQL Models for File Paths**: Handle the actual file path in the SQL models (usually in your staging layer). The `read_csv_auto()` function in DuckDB (or similar functions in other database systems) is used directly in the SQL to load the file.

- **Separation of Logic**: Keep file access logic in SQL files and source metadata in `source.yml` for a clean, modular, and maintainable project.

### Example Structure

Here’s how your project could be organized:

- **`source.yml`** (for documentation):

  ```yaml
  version: 2

  sources:
    - name: raw_csv_data
      description: "Source data from raw CSV files"
      tables:
        - name: sales_data
          description: "Sales data from CSV"
        - name: customers_data
          description: "Customer data from CSV"
  ```

- **Staging SQL Model** (for loading CSV file):

  ```sql
  {{ config(materialized='table') }}

  -- Load raw sales data from the CSV file
  select *
  from read_csv_auto('data/sales_data.csv');
  ```

---

### Conclusion

- **`source.yml`**: Use it for metadata, documentation, and testing of your raw data. Do not store file paths here.
- **SQL Models**: Handle the CSV file paths directly in your SQL models using `read_csv_auto()` or similar file reading functions. This keeps your file handling logic where it belongs and ensures clean separation of concerns.

This approach ensures a modular, maintainable, and scalable dbt project!
