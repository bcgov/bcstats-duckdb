Yes, you can drop all tables with the `"stg"` prefix in their names either using **DuckDB** directly or through **dbt**. Here are two approaches to achieve this:

### 1. **Dropping Tables with `"stg"` Prefix in DuckDB**

You can drop all tables with the `"stg"` prefix directly in **DuckDB** using a dynamic SQL query. DuckDB allows you to query the metadata of the database and then dynamically drop the tables based on a condition.

Here’s how you can do it:

#### Step 1: List All Tables
You can query DuckDB’s system catalog to list all tables, including those with a specific prefix. To list tables that start with `"stg"`, you can use the following SQL:

```sql
SELECT table_name
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_name LIKE 'stg%';
```

#### Step 2: Drop Tables Dynamically
To drop all tables that start with `"stg"`, you can combine this with a `DROP TABLE` command using dynamic SQL.

```sql
PRAGMA enable_profiling;
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
CALL (SELECT 'DROP TABLE IF EXISTS ' || table_name || ';'
      FROM information_schema.tables
      WHERE table_name LIKE 'stg%');
COMMIT;
```

This query will:
1. Query all the tables with the `"stg"` prefix.
2. Dynamically generate and execute a `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS` statement for each of them.

> **Important:** Before running this in production, it’s a good idea to list the tables (using the first query) to ensure you are dropping only the tables you intend to drop.

### 2. **Dropping `"stg"` Tables Using dbt**

While dbt doesn’t have a built-in command to drop tables based on naming conventions, you can achieve this by writing a custom **dbt operation** or a **post-hook** in a model.

#### Option 1: Use dbt to Drop Tables Dynamically (via SQL Model)
You can create a custom dbt model that runs SQL to drop all `"stg"` tables. Here’s how you can implement this:

1. Create a new `.sql` file in your `models/` folder, for example `drop_stg_tables.sql`.

2. In the `.sql` file, write the following query to drop tables with the `"stg"` prefix:

```sql
{{ config(materialized='ephemeral') }}

WITH stg_tables AS (
  SELECT table_name
  FROM information_schema.tables
  WHERE table_name LIKE 'stg%'
)
SELECT 'DROP TABLE IF EXISTS ' || table_name || ';' as drop_statement
FROM stg_tables;
```

This model will generate a `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS` statement for all `"stg"` prefixed tables.

3. Now, you can use a post-hook or a macro to execute these `DROP TABLE` statements within dbt by running the resulting SQL.

#### Option 2: Use dbt Macros to Drop Tables

You can create a **dbt macro** to run the dropping logic. This can be defined in your `macros/` folder:

```sql
{% macro drop_stg_tables() %}
    {% set tables_to_drop = run_query("SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_name LIKE 'stg%'") %}

    {% for table in tables_to_drop %}
        {% set drop_sql = "DROP TABLE IF EXISTS " ~ table %}
        {{ log("Dropping table: " ~ table, info=True) }}
        {{ run_query(drop_sql) }}
    {% endfor %}
{% endmacro %}
```

Then, you can call this macro within a dbt operation, or as a part of your pipeline to drop all `"stg"` tables.

#### Running the Macro

To run the macro as part of your pipeline, you can create a new `dbt run-operation` step:

```bash
dbt run-operation drop_stg_tables
```

This command will execute the macro and drop all the tables with `"stg"` in their names.

### Conclusion

- **DuckDB Approach**: Use a SQL script in DuckDB to dynamically query and drop tables with the `"stg"` prefix.
- **dbt Approach**: Use dbt models or macros to generate and execute `DROP TABLE` statements for the `"stg"` tables.

Both methods will work, but the **DuckDB approach** is more straightforward if you're working directly with DuckDB, while the **dbt approach** fits more naturally within a dbt-managed pipeline, allowing for more integration into your development workflow.
