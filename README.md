## Testing DuckDB as a Data Storage Solution for BC Stats Analytics Teams

### Objectives
The primary objective of this proposal is to demonstrate the capabilities of DuckDB as a viable alternative to traditional, more costly transactional data management systems. We intend to initiate a small-scale project that will serve as a proof of concept, showcasing DuckDB's efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and ability to handle large, varied datasets. This project will aim to:
1. Centralize a subset of our large population and demography datasets within DuckDB.
2. Simplify the process of setting up, linking, querying and analyzing structured, tabular data from multiple sources.
3. Evaluate DuckDBâ€™s performance in handling complex analytical queries and its integration with existing tools. 

### Rationale
DuckDB offers several advantages over other transaction database solutions for our use case:
1. Cost-Effectiveness: DuckDB is free and open-source, eliminating licensing costs associated with standalone database servers. DuckDB can be hosted on a local or network drive, has no software dependencies and does not require a server.
2.	Performance: Despite being lightweight, DuckDB is feature-rich and optimized for fast analytical queries and can efficiently handle large datasets (e.g., hundreds of gigabyte-scale).
3.	Ease of Integration: DuckDB is designed to be easily embedded within various programming environments, making it highly compatible with our existing workflows.
4.	Flexibility: DuckDB supports multiple data formats natively, reducing the need for extensive data transformation and preprocessing.
Limitations: DuckDB is not designed for frequent CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) operations, and only one user can write to the DuckDB database at a time (but note many users can read and query simultaneously).  BC Stats is primarily a data analytics shop and our data is not frequently updated so these limitations might be easily mitigated.


## Overview

This project is designed to load multiple CSV files into a DuckDB database using **dbt** (Data Build Tool). It helps automate the process of transforming, modeling, and querying data from CSV files in a simple and efficient way. DuckDB is used as the local database engine, and dbt orchestrates the loading and transformation process.

Previously, we implemented the data engineering part in R. For example, reading CSV files and writing to a DuckDB database etc. You can find the code in `01_load_duckdb_cli.sql`, `01_load_duckdb.r`, `01_load_sql_server.r`, and `01_load_sql_sqlite.r`. 

Now most of data engineering work is moved to `sei_dbt` folder. The instructions are available in `readme.md` in `sei_dbt` folder.

## Project Status

This project is currently in active development. 
The core functionality of loading CSV files into DuckDB using dbt is complete. 

Some tests in terms of the reading speed are done in `05_comparison_dplyr_duckdb.r`.
